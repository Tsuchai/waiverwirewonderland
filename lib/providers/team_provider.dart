// This file will hold the state for the user's team roster.
// We will use Riverpod to manage this state.

// We'll need to define:
// 1. A data model for a Player.
// 2. A StateNotifier class that holds the list of players and has methods to add/remove them.
// 3. A global provider that allows the UI to access the StateNotifier.
